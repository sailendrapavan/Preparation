LinkedList in java implements list queue , dqueue and list...
Based on our requirement we can use example

If you want linked list to behave as dequeue the we should use thw below
Deque<Integer> d = new LinkedList<Integer>();

If you want linked list to be used as queue
		Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();
		
If you want linked list to work as List then

		List<Integer> ll = new LinkedList<Integer>();

But implementation of add and other methods is different from array list....

Check the difference between 

add 				offer
element				peek
remove				poll

Linked list has its own implementation

    public boolean add(E e) {
        linkLast(e);
        return true;
    }
