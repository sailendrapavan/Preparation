What do you understand synchronize here?

Vector is a thread safe object. if you open Vector source code you will see all the method 
are taged with synchronize keyword which say the access to that methods are controlled or synchronized. 
which makes Vector a thread safe. when multiple threads are accesing this Vector object, the object wil be 
synchronized. The quite opposite datastructure to this is ArrayList, which is not thread safe means not synchronized.

Main difference between vector and list is check the above vector source code all the methods are synchronised so they are thread safe but array list is 
not thread safe 

List grows by 50% but vector doubles the size,,,in vector we can specify by what size it can expand
List and vector has minimum capacity is 10

List and vector internally use the array of type object and do modifications on it 

If size grows it copies into new array of objects and performs operation

Vector can be iterated though enumeration

To be short, Enumeration is legacy Iterator and Enum is a data type. Enums are instance controlled classes in java. ... 
While Enumeration was the old way to iterate through a collection. It has two methods nextElement and hasMoreElements which are more
 like next and hasNext methods of Iterator interface.Oct 18, 2013


Order is preserved in both array list and vector
